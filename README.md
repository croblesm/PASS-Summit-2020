# PASS Summit 2020
## [Embracing Database DevOps through CI/CD](https://www.pass.org/summit/2020/Learn/Session-Details/sid/104708)

Evolutionary Database Design is the best phrase it can describe database migrations. But what do we know about database migrations using SQL Server containers?

This session will provide you with answers and guidelines to get you started, to embrace the Database DevOps practice for your organization. You will learn the aspects, methods, and strategies to build and manage your database deployments through CI/CD pipelines with open source tools like Flyway, Kubernetes, and cloud collaborative tools like Azure DevOps.

You will be able to build your first database migration through a CI/CD pipeline at the end of this session.
